Deftones Lyrics
"Some People"

Some people think that they can get behind your back and they can say whatever they wanna
But you see I can't let 'em get away whether because it's wrong or no I'm not gonna

You can sit and lie in your bed, you can think and think then come
Up with an answer, but people who say foolish things they say
You said words that I'd rather not mention
Well it won't get to me the right way is the way that I see it won't
Bring me down it won't
The people learn that the people that think that they can get right
Behind your back and do what they wanna
But you see I can't let 'em get away whether because it's wrong
Or no I'm not gonna

You can sit and lie in your bed, you can think and think then come up with an answer
But people who say foolish things they say you said words that I'd rather not mention

Well I will not let it be, judging from the way that I see it won't bring me down, it won't

And they can get behind your back and say what they want and
Think it's right when till the time
When you get sick of putting up with all them
Well now I'm here in my home I'm (in my own mind) thinking about the way
I've been accepting this youth (these views) I've always took, am I wasted?

So now I fall, down to my death
You came and took it upon your own
But you can't tame a dog that's dead
Yeah
